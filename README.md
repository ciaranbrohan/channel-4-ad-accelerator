## Background
I've been on a taskmaster binge lately and channel 4 has great content but annoying ads. So taking inspiration from [rkk3's youtube ad accelerator](https://github.com/rkk3/ad-accelerator/tree/main) I decided to take a stab at building my own one for channel 4. Will look at adding RTE Player support and maybe virgin media player also.
