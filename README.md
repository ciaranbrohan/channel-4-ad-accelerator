# Channel 4 Player Ad Accelerator

## What is it?

A chrome extension to automatically mute and fastforward or skip through video advertisements on channel 4

## Background
I've been on a taskmaster binge lately and channel 4 has great content but annoying ads. So taking inspiration from [rkk3's youtube ad accelerator](https://github.com/rkk3/ad-accelerator/tree/main) I decided to take a stab at building my own one for channel 4. Will look at adding RTE Player support and maybe virgin media player also.


- [x] add support for rte player
- [ ] add suport for virgin media player
- [ ] improve popup and icons
- [ ] look at setting ad timer to end of the video so it instantly skips instead of speeds it up.
- [ ] package and release project as plugin so others can use it
